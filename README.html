      <h2><a name="whatIs">What is Winstone ?</a></h2>
    
      <p>Winstone is a servlet container that was written out of a desire to provide servlet
        functionality without the bloat that full J2EE compliance introduces.</p>
    
      <p>It is not intended to be a completely fully functional J2EE style servlet 
        container (by this I mean supporting extraneous APIs unrelated to Servlets, such as 
        JNDI, JavaMail, EJBs, etc) - this is left to Tomcat, Jetty, Resin, JRun, Weblogic et al. </p>
    
      <p>Sometimes you want just a simple servlet container - without all the other junk - that just goes. 
        This is where Winstone is best suited.</p>
    
      <p>The original goals in writing Winstone were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Supply fast, reliable servlet container functionality for a single webapp per server</li>
        <li>Keep the size of the core distribution jar as low as possible (currently 166KB)</li>
        <li>Keep configuration files to an absolute minimum, using command line options to 
          optionally override sensible compiled in defaults. </li>
        <li>Eventually compile with GCJ to make a 3-4Meg windows exe for local development/deployment 
          of servlets. This has not happened yet, because of some GCJ class loading problems.</li>
        <li>Optionally support JSP compilation using Apache's Jasper. (http://jakarta.apache.org)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h2><a name="whyCalled">Why is it called Winstone ?</a></h2>
      <p>The short version (because the long version is way too politically incorrect) is as follows: </p>
    
      <p>Winstone is the name of a rather large Jamaican man a friend of mine met one night, while 
        he was out clubbing in the Roppongi area of Tokyo. He (my friend) was a little 
        liquored up at the time, and when Winstone suggested they head to "this really cool club" 
        he knew, he didn't think anything was wrong. It wasn't until Winstone led him down a dark 
        stairwell and dropped his trousers that my friend clued in and ran like hell.</p>
    
      <p>It was too good a story to let die, so I named this project Winstone so that said friend 
        will continue to be reminded of it. Heheheh ....</p>

      <h2><a name="using">Using Winstone</a></h2>
      <p>If you want to build from source code, you will need to download and install Apache Maven (v1.x). The
        following instructions assume you have already installed Maven and have the maven shell script in
        your path (to get Maven, see http://maven.apache.org/).</p>
    
      <p>To build Winstone, unpack the tree:</p>
    
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<code>tar zxf winstone-src-0.9.10.tar.gz</code>
    
      <p>Then build it:</p>
    
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<code>cd winstone</code><br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<code>maven clean jar</code>
    
      <p>The winstone.jar file will be in the target directory after the build is complete.</p>
    
      <p>To run it:</p>
    
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<code>java -jar target/winstone-0.9.10.jar --webroot=&lt;location of webroot&gt; </code> (+ other options)
    
      <p> - OR - </p>

      <h2><a name="configFile">Configuration file</a></h2>
      <p>You don't really need a config file, but sometimes it's handy to be able to use the same settings
        each time without running through the command history.</p>
    
      <p>Winstone looks for a config file <code>winstone.properties</code> in the current directory (or in the location 
        specified with --config) at startup. It loads the properties in this file, overrides them with any
        supplied command line properties, and then starts itself.</p>
    
      <p>This is just intended as a handy feature for people who want to cache regular startup options, rather
        than using batch files.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2><a name="deployChoices">Deployment choices</a></h2>
      <p>The <b>simplest way</b> to use winstone is with a single webapp. To do this, just supply the warfile or webroot 
        directory as an argument:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>java -jar winstone.jar &lt;webroot or warfile&gt;</code>, (this method auto-detects the type) or</li>
          <li><code>java -jar winstone.jar --webroot=&lt;webroot&gt;</code>, or</li>
          <li><code>java -jar winstone.jar --warfile=&lt;warfile&gt;</code></li>
        </ul>
      <p>If you need to support <b>multiple webapps</b>, use the <code>--webappsDir</code> switch, to which you pass a 
        directory that contains multiple warfiles/webroots.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>java -jar winstone.jar --webappsDir=&lt;dir containing multiple webroots&gt;</code></li>
        </ul>        
      <p>The directory becomes the prefix name for that webapp (so hello becomes /hello, etc). The directory named
        ROOT becomes the no-prefix webapp.</p>
      <p>So, for example, if you had a directory <i>/usr/local/webapps</i> which contained sub-directories ROOT 
        and test, if you executed <code>java -jar winstone.jar --webappsDir=/usr/local/webapps</code>, you would 
        find that the test folder would act as a webroot for requests prefixed with <code>/test</code>, while
        other requests would go to the webapp in the ROOT folder</p>
      <p>From v0.8, if you need <b>multiple hosts (sometimes called <i>name-based virtual hosting</i>)</b>, there is a
        new option <code>--hostsDir</code>. This acts in a similar way to the <code>--webappsDir</code> switch,
        but it defines an extra level of sub-directories, the top being a per-host directory and the second a 
        per-webapp directory as with <code>--webappsDir</code>.</p>
      <p>The directory name becomes the host name: that is, a directory named "www.blah.com" will only serve 
        requests with the host header www.blah.com, unless it is the default host. If a directory named "default"
        is found, it becomes the default host. If no default directory is found, the first directory in the list 
        (alphabetically) becomes the default host.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>java -jar winstone.jar --hostsDir=&lt;dir containing multiple host directories&gt;</code></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2><a name="caveats">Caveats</a></h2>
      <p>As a result of the design goals, there are some things Winstone doesn't do:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There are currently three connectors supplied with Winstone:
          <ol>
            <li>An internal HTTP connector - allows plain HTTP/1.1 connections only</li>
            <li>An internal HTTPS connector - allows HTTP/1.1 connections over SSL</li>
            <li>An AJP13 connector - allows connection to Apache/IIS/iPlanet, etc</li>
          </ol>
          While there is an internal HTTPS/SSL connector included, I recommend using 
          Apache 2.0 with the AJP13 connector (instructions below). It has way more configuration
          options than Winstone's connector does.</li>
        <li>HttpSession support is cookie-based only (no URL rewriting). URL rewriting introduces a lot of 
          unnecessary complex request processing, and given that browser cookie support is common these
          days (and no-one I know actually uses URL rewriting), I plan not to implement this.</li>
        <li>The messages are all in English only. Resource bundles are used, but no translations yet.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2><a name="security">Security Warning</a></h2>
      <p>If you enable the controlPort, be aware that there is no password protection at all on this port. 
        Anyone who can get access to this port can stop or restart the server. I plan to 
        add some simple authentication to this at some point, but I'll wait until someone asks for it.</p>
      <p>The controlPort is disabled by default. If you choose not to enable it, the only way to shut
        Winstone down is to kill the process (either by Ctrl-C or kill command).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2><a name="recent">Recent additions</a></h2>
      <p>New features in v0.9:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Added <b>Servlet v2.5 spec support</b>. Please note that the annotations support mentioned 
          in the spec is only for J2EE compliant containers, and Winstone is deliberately only JSR154 compliant. 
          The adding of v2.5 support was purely driven by a requirement in the API license, so except for a bit of
          syntactic sugar in the web.xml and spec clarifications, this isn't really a big deal. Also, 
          while the new spec mandates JDK1.5 or better, winstone should still work with a JDK1.2+ JVM.</li>
        <li>Added <b>Session persistence across reboots</b>. The best thing about winstone (I find) is it's 
          startup time, but restarts are a pain if you have to rebuild a session in order to get to a page you're
          working on. By adding --useSavedSessions to the startup args, you'll enable the feature. See 
          <a href="#sessionPersistence">below</a> for more.</li>
        <li>A lot of <b>session and forwarding related fixes</b> - thanks to Martin Cordova and Robert Boyce for
          pointing these out. These have been bugging me for some time, but having people give you reproducible 
          examples of error cases is often all it takes to fix a long standing problem, and these guys were 
          crucial in providing that.</li>
        <li>A change is <b>JSP deployment requirements</b>. If you use JSPs, please see <a href="#jasper">below</a>.</li>
        <li>AJP connector now apparently works with IIS. Many thanks to Cory Osborn for finding these problems and 
          then debugging and fixing them single-handedly.</li>
        <li>Some classloading changes that should isolate classloading in webapps from each other more thoroughly.</li>
      </ul>        
            
      <p>New features in v0.8:</p>
    
      <ul>
        <li>Expanded the features of the JDBC connection pool to include <b>keep-alive</b> queries
          and block-and-retry behaviour when the pool has been exhausted.</li>
        <li>Added filter match caching (performance improvement)</li>
        <li><b>Name-based virtual hosting</b>. Using the <code>--hostsDir</code> switch, you can define a 
          directory that contains directories named by hostname, each of which acts like a <code>--webappsDir</code>. 
          See <a href="#deployChoices">above</a> for more details.</li>
        <li><b>Access logging</b>. Disabled by default, but enabled with the switch 
          <code>--accessLoggerClassName=winstone.accesslog.SimpleAccessLogger</code>. You can provide your
          own logging implementation, but the simple access logger contains Apache Combined/Common format
          logging and Resin format logging, so it should suffice for most cases. See 
          <a href="#accessLog">below</a> for more details.</li>
        <li><b>Better embedding support</b>. You can now embed warfiles and properties file inside the
          winstone jar itself, for an all-in-one application jar. See <a href="#embedding">below</a> 
          for more details.</li>
        <li>Tested with WebDAV applications. Winstone has now been tested/debugged with Jakarta Slide and 
          Davenport WebDAV applications, and works correctly (previous versions had some obscure bugs 
          that caused WebDAV to fail)</li>
      </ul>
            
      <p>New features in v0.7:</p>
    
      <ul>
        <li>Updated build process to use Apache Maven (see <a href="http://maven.apache.org">
          http://maven.apache.org</a>. Build instructions have been updated to match.</li>
        <li>Source code has been reformatted - a fair bit easier to read now</li>
        <li><b>Multiple webapp support has been added</b>. There's no auto-deploy features yet,
          but that will come soon. Use the --webappsDir=&lt;webapps directory&gt; to declare
          a folder that will have any directories auto-mounted and any warfiles auto-deployed.
          (I originally said this was not going to be included, but changed my mind when I
          realised it could be done with only 10K additional jarfile size).</li>
        <li>Fixed the bugs in the exception handling and error servlet redirection, as
          well as in web xml parsing, and more other places that I can possibly list here.
          If you had some strange bug or incompatibility before, chances are it's been fixed
          now.</li>
        <li><b>Passed the Sun JSR-154 Servlet Test Compatibility Kit (TCK) tests.</b></li>
        <li>I also ran the JSR-152 JSP TCK on winstone with Apache Jasper support enabled, 
          and while it didn't pass all tests, the tests it failed were the same ones the 
          Tomcat failed, so I notified the Tomcat/Jasper developers of the test failures. 
          Currently waiting on a response ... in any case I suspect these are actually test 
          errors rather than implementation errors.</li>
        <li>Better support for open source JVMs. Martin Cordova has been very helpful in 
          testing winstone under a wider range of JVMs, as well as providing some really 
          good feedback on needed features. His tests included JamVM and CacaoVM, as well 
          as IBM's JDK. Jim Huang also reported that winstone works well under Kaffe.</li>
        <li>User definable webapp class loader: This is likely to be of interest to the Aspect
          Oriented Programming crowd. It allows you to write your own class loader class
          (conforming to the same contructor signature as URLClassLoader), and then
          to use it in place of the normal web app class loader with --preferredClassLoader. 
          This allows AspectWerkz style weaving classloaders to be used on webapps where it 
          wouldn't have been otherwise possible (eg JDKs that don't support the profiler 
          option, such as 1.4 and before), or anything else you can think of doing with a 
          custom classloader.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>New features in v0.6:</p>
    
      <ul>
        <li>Updated to <b>Servlet 2.4</b> specification compliance, although I haven't yet
          run Sun's Test Compatibility Kit on it - I'm still waiting for that. It works
          with all of the v2.4 webapps I've tried. The only caveat is that you will need
          Apache Xerces in the system classpath to make it work (see below).</li>
        <li>Updated to <b>JSP 2.0</b> specification compliance. This is the main cause
          for the blowout in size of the larger jar file, but it does result in much 
          simpler set up for Jasper (see below).</li>
        <li>Added a <b>command-line tool</b> for accessing control port options, such as 
          <b>shutdown</b> and <b>restart</b>. Restart is new to this version, and causes 
          a shutdown and redeploy from scratch.</li>
        <li>Added a <b>lib folder</b> for additional jars. This defaults to "lib" under the 
          current directory, with any jar or zip files in this folder being added to the 
          webapp classpath.</li>
        <li>Extensively tested with the <b>Apache Struts and JSTL frameworks</b>. This highlighted
          a number of bugs related to internationalisation I wouldn't have found otherwise.</li>
        <li>Many minor features such as <b>range downloads</b> on static resources, a <b>logfile</b>
          directive for writing log messages to a file, and many MANY performance enhancements and 
          bugfixes. See the TODO.txt file in the source distribution for a full list.</li>
        <li><b>Update: June 28, 2004</b> - Added <b>HTTPS</b> support to version v0.6.4</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>New features in v0.5:</p>
    
      <ul>
        <li>Implemented <b>DIGEST</b> and <b>CERT</b> authentication methods. The CERT type is largely untested 
          (due to lack of A: access to certificates and B: knowledge of browser configuration for client 
          certificates) - if anyone wants to help with testing this, I'd appreciate it.</li>
        <li>Implemented simple <b>clustering</b> (ie sharing of sessions between multiple Winstone instances).
          See below for cluster configuration details.</li>
        <li>Implemented optional <b>JNDI</b> support. This is just a memory-based Context intended for storing 
          lookups on <code>&lt;env-entry&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;resource-ref&gt;</code> references, but 
          it also includes a pooling JDBC DataSource object .... it's funny how you don't realise how important some
          things are until you go without them ....</li>
        <li>The control port has been modified to be more useful. See below for usage instructions.</li>
        <li>The distribution jar is now available in two forms:
          <ol>
            <li><b>Complete version</b> (winstone.jar): This contains the complete winstone feature-set, 
              including AJP13 Apache connectors, Authentication/Realm support and Clustering support.</li>
            <li><b>Lite version</b> (winstone-lite.jar): This is the core winstone feature-set only,
              ie commonly used servlet features, as fast and reliable as possible, with unnecessary options 
              removed.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>New features in v0.4:</p>
    
      <ul>
        <li>Implemented the <b>&lt;error-page&gt;</b> directive</li>
        <li>Added object pools for request/response objects for performance reasons</li>
        <li>The handler pools are now controllable via startup properties</li>
        <li><b>Servlet reloading</b> is now supported (optionally - include 
          <code>--useServletReloading=true</code> at startup)</li>
        <li>The initial <b>Authentication Model</b> is in place (see below for help). There are two base 
          classes that make it work: <code>AuthenticationRealm</code> and <code>AuthenticationHandler</code>. 
          Currently Argument-based and File-based realms (ie user/password details supplied via command-line args 
          or XML files) and HTTP BASIC and FORM authentication are implemented, but the others (DIGEST and 
         CERT authentication forms) will come soon.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>New features in v0.3:</p>
    
      <ul>
        <li>The request handler threads now use <b>monitors</b>, which allows them to exist beyond a single
          request/response cycle. The benefit here is performance - it removes a serious bottleneck.</li>
        <li><b>WAR files</b> are now supported via the --warfile attribute. If you specify a warfile in this 
          manner, it will be automatically extracted by the container to a temp directory, overwriting
          only files that are older than the archive date.</li>
        <li><b>Servlet attribute, session, and context listeners</b> (Servlet spec v2.3) are now fully supported. 
          The HttpSessionActivationListener class will be fully supported once the session transfer
          is implemented.</li>
        <li><b>Servlet Filters</b> (Servlet spec v2.3) are now fully supported.</li>
        <li>There is now an <b>AJP13 connector</b>, which means Winstone will now work behind Apache/IIS/etc
          using Tomcat's mod_jk. Try it out and see ... there's a section below on using the mod_jk connector.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2><a name="xerces">Using Xerces as an XML parser (required for v2.4 webapps)</a></h2>

      <p>As part of the upgrade in the servlet specification, the v2.4 incarnation of the
        web.xml file is validated using XML Schema Documents (XSD) as opposed to Document Type
        Definitions (DTD). While I still have no idea why such a change was necessary - especially 
        given that DTD validation seems to be more than enough in this case - I did implement it. 
        Perhaps the people on the specification committee might want to give a thought to container 
        size next time round, as this one change multiplies the size of the distribution by five.</p>
    
      <p>Anyway, to use Xerces, you'll need to download the latest Xerces-J parser from 
        <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/">here</a>, and copy xercesImpl.jar and xml-apis.jar
        into a folder somewhere (name it "endorsed"). Putting them in the winstone/lib folder will not work,
        because they must be in the system endorsed classpath to override the JDK internal XML parser.</p>
    
      <p>Then add <code>-Djava.endorsed.dirs=&lt;endorsed dir name&gt;</code> as a JVM arg to your 
        command line for starting winstone, eg:</p>
        <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;java -Djava.endorsed.dirs=/jdk/endorsed -jar winstone.jar --webroot=...</pre>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2><a name="jasper">JSPs (aka using with Jasper)</a></h2>
      <p>Winstone supports JSPs using Apache's Jasper JSP compiler. Thanks to a rather clever 
        design by the Jasper team, this was much less work than I expected - well done Jasper guys.</p>
      <p>Required steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Add --useJasper to your startup command line, since
          JSPs are disabled by default</li>
    
        <li>
          <p>Both the v1.x and v2.x versions of Jasper are supported. In order to turn on JSP compilation
            in Winstone, you'll need to place the following jar files into the lib folder under the 
            current directory (or the folder identified by the --commonLibFolder directive).</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>jasper-compiler.jar, jasper-runtime.jar, ant.jar, jsp-api.jar</b> - 
               Not supplied with Winstone. You can get this from the standard Tomcat binary download location. 
               Just download the latest Tomcat, and copy these three files into the lib folder 
               for Winstone. They will be in the tomcat_home/common/lib folder.</li>
    
            <li><b>commons-logging-api.jar, commons-el.jar (Jasper 2 only)</b> - 
               These are required if you are using Jasper 2.0. You can get them from the 
               tomcat binary distribution or separately from the link below.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>All of these are available from the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/binindex.cgi">Jakarta download site</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>You'll also need <b>tools.jar</b>, and this is handled a little differently. 
          The ant javac compile task needs this to turn the generated .java files into 
          .class files at runtime. You should already have this in the &lt;java_home&gt;/lib folder 
          of your jdk.</p>
    
          <p>There are two new startup arguments for Winstone --javaHome and --toolsJar. You 
          should only need to set --javaHome to make Jasper work properly. Your startup might
          look like this:</p>
      
          <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;java -jar winstone.jar --useJasper \
                         --javaHome=c:\java\jdk1.4.2 \
                         --webroot=...</pre>
          <p>Additionally, you can specify the exact location of the toolsJar file like this:</p>
          <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;java -jar winstone.jar --useJasper \
                         --javaHome=c:\java\jdk1.4.2 \
                         --toolsJar=c:\tools.jar \
                         --webroot=...</pre>
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>Newer versions of Jasper seem to use the Eclipse JDT compiler, and therefore don't require tools.jar.
        You might want to try deploying the jasper related jars yourself - see if you can get it running with just
        a JRE configuration. Shouldn't be difficult, just a little debugging of which jar files are necessary.</p>
            
      <p><b>CHANGED:</b> Until v0.9.5, it wasn't necessary to add the jsp-api.jar, because winstone included it's own copy of the
        JSP API classes. However, the JSP v2.1 spec mandates the use of JDK1.5 generics in the API classes, so in order
        to continue supplying the API classes, Winstone would have to require JDK1.5 compilation as a minimum. Since a 
        large percentage of people use Winstone for it's small footprint, and PDAs running on older spec JVMs are affected by 
        this, it seemed more reasonable to just drop the JSP API classes and maintain the backwards compatibility.</p>
    
      <p>I disagree with the Expert Group's penchant for trading away backwards compatibility in exchange for 
        spec features that are unnecessary (such as generics and XSD support). But at the end of the day, they call
        the shots, so I just do what I can to minimize the downsides in practice.</p>

      <h2><a name="apache">Connecting to Apache</a></h2>
      <p>These instructions are for beginners: if you know your way around Apache and Tomcat, you'll know what's going on here.</p>
      <p>Download and install Apache for your platform (and obviously Winstone too), then follow these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Download mod_jk.dll/so into the apache modules directory</li>
        <li>Add the following to the apache conf file (httpd.conf): 
<pre>
LoadModule jk_module modules/mod_jk.dll

&lt;Location "/&lt;Winstone Prefix&gt;/*"&gt;
JkMount /* ajp13
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre></li>
        <li>Create a new file called workers.properties in the apache conf directory, with the following contents
<pre>
worker.list=ajp13
worker.ajp13.port=8009
worker.ajp13.host=localhost
worker.ajp13.type=ajp13
</pre></li>
        <li>Start up Winstone, ensuring that the --ajp13Port=8009 is in the startup args.</li>
        <li>Start up Apache and try connecting to your webapp on the apache port, with the Winstone 
          URL prefix. If it doesn't work, try looking at the apache error.log file for hints. If you get hex dumps, mail
          them to the winstone-devel list, together with any stack traces winstone generated.</li>
      </ol>
    
      <p>Please note this is not an optimal configuration for production uses. This is provided purely for those
        who need some help to get started. Read the mod_jk documentation with Tomcat for more detailed info. 
        Additionally, Costin Manolache of the Tomcat team suggested I point out that the "jvmRoute" feature
        (used for managing sticky session behaviour when clustering multiple Winstone's behind a single Apache)
        is not supported. This may change in the future - we'll see how it goes.</p>

      <h2><a name="authRealms">Using Authentication Realms</a></h2>
      <p>The process here is almost identical to that of Tomcat (I know this because I used the Tomcat examples
        webapp to develop against). There are two components - the web.xml component and selecting/configuring
        an AuthenticationRealm class.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The web.xml part is the same for all webapps - you include the <code>&lt;security-constraint&gt;</code>
          and <code>&lt;login-config&gt;</code> elements as required, eg (from the Tomcat examples web.xml):
<pre>
&lt;security-constraint&gt;
  &lt;display-name&gt;Example Security Constraint&lt;/display-name&gt;
  &lt;web-resource-collection&gt;
    &lt;web-resource-name&gt;Protected Area&lt;/web-resource-name&gt;
    &lt;url-pattern&gt;/jsp/security/protected/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
    &lt;http-method&gt;DELETE&lt;/http-method&gt;
    &lt;http-method&gt;GET&lt;/http-method&gt;
    &lt;http-method&gt;POST&lt;/http-method&gt;
    &lt;http-method&gt;PUT&lt;/http-method&gt;
  &lt;/web-resource-collection&gt;
  &lt;auth-constraint&gt;
    &lt;role-name&gt;tomcat&lt;/role-name&gt;
    &lt;role-name&gt;role1&lt;/role-name&gt;
  &lt;/auth-constraint&gt;
&lt;/security-constraint&gt;

&lt;login-config&gt;
  &lt;auth-method&gt;FORM&lt;/auth-method&gt;
  &lt;realm-name&gt;Example Form-Based Authentication Area&lt;/realm-name&gt;
  &lt;form-login-config&gt;
    &lt;form-login-page&gt;/jsp/security/protected/login.jsp&lt;/form-login-page&gt;
    &lt;form-error-page&gt;/jsp/security/protected/error.jsp&lt;/form-error-page&gt;
  &lt;/form-login-config&gt;
&lt;/login-config&gt;
</pre></li>
    
        <li>The AuthenticationRealm part is Winstone specific. Here you currently have three options:
          <ol>
            <li><b>ArgumentsRealm:</b> Here you simply add additional command line args for each user's password and
              role list. Passwords are added with <code>--argumentsRealm.passwd.&lt;username&gt;=&lt;password&gt;</code>, 
              and roles are added with <code>--argumentsRealm.roles.&lt;username&gt;=&lt;role1&gt;,&lt;role2&gt;</code></li>
            <li><b>FileRealm:</b> This is the same as the Tomcat <code>tomcat-users.xml</code> file. 
              Pass in the command line arguments <code>--realmClassName=winstone.realm.FileRealm 
              --fileRealm.configFile=&lt;filename&gt;</code>, and it should work exactly the way Tomcat does by default.</li>
            <li><b>Write your own:</b> You just have to extend the <code>winstone.AuthenticationRealm</code> class,
              and override the appropriate methods (as the File and Arguments Realms do), and specify the class name in
              <code>--realmClassName</code>.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>This component is left intentionally fairly simple, and relatively extracted. I'm planning to break the realm and
        authentication stuff into an optional jar later, since not many webapps I've seen use it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2><a name="cluster">Cluster support</a></h2>
      <p>It should be pointed out in the beginning that the Cluster support currently implemented in Winstone
        is actually just session sharing. If a request comes to a node in the cluster that doesn't recognise the
        session ID supplied, that node simply asks the others "Do you know this session ?". If one does know it, 
        it transfers the session to the requesting node, and the requesting node carries on as if it had always
        had the session in the first place.</p>
    
      <p>If a specific node in the cluster goes offline, so do all the sessions that it was holding. There is no
        active "push" of sessions to other nodes, so as far as resilience to failure goes, this cluster is 
        fairly weak. The clustering provided here is meant to allow a dumb load balancer to redirect requests
        randomly across a cluster of Winstone instances without requiring it to be "session sticky".</p>
    
      <p>That said, the configuration is fairly simple. The only information you need is the IP address and control
        port of at least one other active node in the cluster. Once you have that, add the following options to
        the command line startup:</p>
<pre>
java -jar winstone.jar ...&lt; other options &gt; ... \
                       --controlPort=&lt;myControlPort&gt; \
                       --useCluster \
                       --clusterNodes=&lt;IP1:controlPort1&gt;
</pre>
        <p>where IP1 is the IP address of the other node in the cluster, and myControlPort and controlPort1 are the port
        numbers to use for the control ports of this instance and the other node respectively. Note that it is necessary
        to actively set the controlPort on this instance, since it is disabled by default.</p>
    
      <p>You would likewise set up the other instance with reciprocal options (ie changing the IPs and controlPort values
        appropriately.</p>
    
      <p>NOTE: There are some additional requirements on your web application for Clustering of sessions to be 
        successful.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>You need to include the <b>&lt;distributable/&gt;</b> element in your web.xml file. This tells Winstone that
          your webapp is programmed correctly to support clustering. If this is missing, clustering will be disabled.</li>
        <li>Any objects you add to the session must implement <b>java.io.Serializable</b>. This is required because
          Winstone serializes the objects in the session over the controlPort to other nodes, and reconstructs the
          serialized session at the destination. If you try to put a non-serializable object into the session, 
          Winstone will throw an exception reminding you to make all session objects serializable.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2><a name="controlPort">Control port functions/protocol</a></h2>
    
      <p>From v0.5, the behaviour of the control port changes slightly. Due to increased usage of the control port
        by the clustering function, a rudimentary protocol has been added. </p>
    
      <p>The protocol is very simple. The first byte sent to the server is a flag indicating what type of request
        is being issued. Beyond that the protocol varies for each request type, but the request type flag options
        are listed below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>0 (ASCII 48)</b> = shutdown</li>
          <li><b>1 (ASCII 49)</b> = request search for a session</li>
          <li><b>2 (ASCII 50)</b> = request list of currently connected cluster nodes</li>
          <li><b>3 (ASCII 51)</b> = cluster node heartbeat</li>
          <li><b>4 (ASCII 52)</b> = request reload of web application context</li>
        </ul>
    
      <p>Obviously, unless you're planning to write your own cluster extensions, the only two you will be interested
       in are the shutdown and reload options. Luckily there is a wrapper class for accessing these functions, named
       <code>winstone.tools.WinstoneControl</code>. Try the following to get a usage statement:</p>
         <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;java -cp winstone.jar winstone.tools.WinstoneControl</pre>

      <h2><a name="jndi">JNDI support</a></h2>

      <p>I know that in the introduction I said that Winstone was only going to support the core servlet APIs, but
        I've since discovered that most people use just a little more than the core servlet API offers. For 
        example, some people use just a JNDI JavaMail session to send administrator error mails, while others want
        to offer a simple servlet over SSL (and hence need Apache), still others use just a JNDI DataSource
        to keep a reference to the connection pool.</p>
    
      <p>For this reason I've included a really basic optional JNDI service within Winstone. For the moment,
        it supports simple operations (such as bind, lookup, rebind, etc) and allows you to store references to 
        environment variables (drawn from the env-entry elements in web.xml and/or command line arguments).</p>
    
      <p>NOTE: JNDI support is disabled by default. It must be enabled using <code>--useJNDI=true</code></p>
    
      <p>Configuration can be done in two ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>&lt;env-entry&gt; elements</b> - This is the standard way to add simple objects, such as
            sql strings or configuration integers/strings. For example:
<pre>
  &lt;env-entry&gt;
    &lt;env-entry-name&gt;test/hello&lt;/env-entry-name&gt;
    &lt;env-entry-type&gt;java.lang.Integer&lt;/env-entry-type&gt;
    &lt;env-entry-value&gt;45&lt;/env-entry-value&gt;
  &lt;/env-entry&gt;
</pre></li>
          <li><b>Command line arguments</b> - This is for more complex objects that require attributes
            to be created (JDBC DataSources for example). The syntax here involves adding a clause of the
            kind <code>--jndi.resource.&lt;resName&gt;=&lt;className&gt;</code> for each object to create,
            followed by <code>--jndi.param.&lt;resName&gt;.&lt;attName&gt;=&lt;attValue&gt;</code> for each
            attribute required. For example:
<pre>
java -jar winstone.jar ...&lt; other options &gt; ... \
                        --useJNDI=true \
                        --jndi.resource.test=java.lang.Float \
                        --jndi.param.test.value=45.56
</pre></li>
        </ul>
      
     
      <p>Additionally, it includes a JDBC DataSource object which can be used as a wrapper around normal JDBC 
        drivers. This is fairly simple for now, but it meets the requirements I mentioned above. Options are as
        follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>url (REQUIRED)</b> - JDBC URL (<code>jdbc:mysql://db.widgets.com/db</code>)</li>
          <li><b>driverClassName (REQUIRED)</b> - JDBC Driver name (eg <code>com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</code>)</li>
          <li><b>username</b> - username for database authentication</li>
          <li><b>password</b> - password for database authentication</li>
          <li><b>maxConnections</b> - Maximum number of connections allowed in the pool. Default is 20</li>
          <li><b>maxIdle</b> - Maximum number of idle connections allowed in the pool. Default is 10</li>
          <li><b>startConnections</b> - The number of connections to open the pool with. Deafault is 2</li>
          <li><b>keepAliveSQL</b> - The sql to execute on keep-alive (or checkBeforeGet) operations. Default is empty</li>
          <li><b>checkBeforeGet</b> - If true, executes the keepAliveSQL before any connection is returned 
            from the pool. Default is true if the keepAliveSQL is defined</li>
          <li><b>keepAlivePeriod</b> - Execute the keepAliveSQL on all unused connection every n minutes. Default is disabled</li>
          <li><b>killInactivePeriod</b> - Kills excess unused connections every n minutes. Default is disabled</li>
          <li><b>retryCount</b> - When the pool is maxed out, block and retry n times. Default is 1 retry</li>
          <li><b>retryPeriod</b> - The period (in ms) over which the retry blocks. Default is 1000ms</li>
        </ol>
    
      <p>For example to create a DataSource object at the JNDI location java:/comp/env/jdbc/connPool, use the 
        following command line (or config file) options:</p>
<pre>
java -jar winstone.jar ...&lt; other options &gt; ... \
                        --useJNDI=true \
                        --jndi.resource.jdbc/connPool=javax.sql.DataSource \
                        --jndi.param.jdbc/connPool.url=jdbc:mysql://db.widgets.com/db \
                        --jndi.param.jdbc/connPool.driverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver \
                        --jndi.param.jdbc/connPool.username=foo \
                        --jndi.param.jdbc/connPool.password=bar
</pre>

      <h2><a name="https">HTTPS support</a></h2>
      
      <p>Somebody asked me to add HTTPS support, using the JDK 1.4 SSL socket classes, and
        so I decided to give it a try. It was a lot easier than expected - the API was really
        nice to use. Unfortunately the hard work seems to be in the configuration, rather
        than the programming.</p>
        
      <p>I recommend using a shareware tool called KeyStore Explorer, available 
        <a href="http://www.lazgosoftware.com/kse/index.html">here</a>. It's much easier than
        all that messy CLI stuff.</p>  
        
      <p>The steps are basically as follows:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Create an empty keystore of type JKS</li>
        <li>Generate a key pair (Tools -&gt; Generate Key Pair). I chose RSA 2048 bit, and used
          "MD5 with RSA" for the algorithm. Set a password and remember it.</li>
        <li>Generate a CSR (right click, Generate CSR).</li>
        <li>Send the CSR to a Certifying Authority (CA) for processing. I used FreeSSL.com,
          because it was only US$39 per year.</li>
        <li>Once you get the approved certificate back, import it into the key store you
          were using (Tools -&gt; import CA reply). You should now have only a
          key pair and a certificate. Save the key store, using the same password you used
          before.</li>
        <li>Start winstone with the following command:
      <pre>java -jar winstone.jar --webroot=&lt;webroot&gt;
                       --httpsPort=443 
                       --httpsKeyStore=&lt;keystore file&gt; 
                       --httpsKeyStorePassword=&lt;password&gt;</pre>  
          </li>
          <li>Set your hosts file (/etc/hosts or c:/Winnt/system32/drivers/etc/hosts) to 
            point the name on your certificate to 127.0.0.1, then try to browse to 
            https://(name on certificate)/</li>
        </ol>

      <h2><a name="accessLog">Access Logging</a></h2>

      <p>From v0.8, there's an option to allow access logging. It's disabled by default, but can be enabled 
        by defining a logging implementation class, with --accessLoggerClassName. The class defined must be 
        an implementation of the interface winstone.AccessLogger, and is defined container wide, but instantiated
        once per webapp.</p>
            
      <p>The supplied logger is called winstone.accesslog.SimpleAccessLogger. It supports Apache style combined/common
        format logs, as well as Resin format (which is actually just Apache common style plus a user agent). 
        Configuration options are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>--simpleAccessLogger.format</b>: Either "combined", "common", "resin" or a pattern made up of wildcards. 
          For example, the combined format string is:
            <pre>###ip### - ###user### ###time### "###uriLine###" ###status### ###size### "###referer###" "###userAgent###"</pre>
          but you can re-arrange this to be any pattern of the above wildcards with the --accessLoggerFormat 
          switch. Defaults to "combined"</li>
        <li><b>--simpleAccessLogger.file</b>: A pattern for defining the files to log to. The default value is 
          <code>logs/###host###/###webapp###_access.log</code>, which splits the log files for different webapps
          and hosts into directories. The wildcards <code>###host###</code> and <code>###webapp###</code> can be 
          moved around or even omitted. Omitting the wildcard will mean the access logs will be combined into 
          shared files (since the file name will be the same)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>For example, to enable Apache Combined style logging to separate files, use a command line like:</p>
            <pre>java -jar winstone.jar --hostsDir=&lt;vhostsDir&gt;
                           --accessLoggerClassName=winstone.accesslog.SimpleAccessLogger</pre>
      <p>Or to log just the date and URI for all hosts/webapps to a single file, use a command line like:</p>
            <pre>java -jar winstone.jar --hostsDir=&lt;vhostsDir&gt;
                       --accessLoggerClassName=winstone.accesslog.SimpleAccessLogger
                       --simpleAccessLogger.format=###date###\ ###uriLine###
                       --simpleAccessLogger.file=/mylogs/access_log.txt</pre>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
      <h2><a name="embedding">Embedding Winstone</a></h2>
      <p>The design of Winstone has always allowed its easy embedding within another application. It's as simple
        as:</p>
  <pre> // at startup
Map args = new HashMap();
args.put("webroot", "&lt;my webroot dir&gt;"); // or any other command line args, eg port
Launcher.initLogger(args);
Launcher winstone = new Launcher(args); // spawns threads, so your application doesn't block

... (your application code)

// before shutdown
winstone.shutdown(); </pre>

      <p>From v0.8 though, there is also the ability to embed in the opposite direction: that is, to 
        <b>embed your warfile into the winstone JAR itself</b>. This allows an all-in-one container plus 
        web-application JAR file to be downloaded, and then unpacked at execution time.</p>
      <p>To use this, simply unpack the winstone JAR, and place your WAR file inside the unpacked 
        folder at the top level (with the same parent as the folder named "winstone"). Then rename
        your WAR file to "embedded.war", and repack the jar as before (make sure to preserve the 
        META-INF and manifest).</p>
      <p>Now if you type: <code>"java -jar winstone.jar"</code>, your application should
        automatically deploy as the ROOT web application. Try <code>http://localhost:8080/</code> to 
        check it out.</p>
      <p>If you need to add any default command-line arguments (eg ports or prefixes), you can embed 
        a properties file in exactly the same way, except that the file must be named 
        "embedded.properties".</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2><a name="sessionPersistence">Session persistence across reboots</a></h2>
    
      <p>From v0.9.5, if you start with --useSavedSessions as an argument, all sessions in the container will be 
        saved to disk after each request, and loaded on container startup. The effect is that sessions will 
        persist across reboots, instead of being lost (which is the default behaviour, or --useSavedSessions=false).</p>
      <p>This is useful for development time, if only to prevent you from having to log in to your webapp every 
        time you restart the container. It does however come with a few costs / side effects to think about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Security:</b> The sessions are serialized to disk in the webapp temp directory (see the spec 
          for details) which is, by default, inside the system temp directory. If you are worried about people
          being able to read these files on a shared machine, set the temp directory manually with 
          -Djava.io.tmpdir=&lt;path&gt;</li>
        <li><b>Speed:</b> Each time a request accesses a session, that session is re-saved to disk before the
          request completes. This introduces a slight hit performance-wise, but it's after the request has released
          the output stream, so there's good chance you won't notice any slow-down, except maybe under load or heavy
          keep-alive usage.</li>
        <li><b>Serializability:</b> You'll need to make sure anything you put in the session implements 
          java.io.Serializable (for obvious reasons). This follows the same rules about session contents, 
          as the "distributable" webapp / clustering feature, since it shares a large chunk of it's code.</li>
      </ul>        
      <p>Please give this feature a try if you can, and let me know if you hit any problems. It is still a little
        green around the edges, so any feedback or corrections will be appreciated.</p>
