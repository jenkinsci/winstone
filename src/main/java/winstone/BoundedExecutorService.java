/**
 * Wraps {@link Executor} so that we only ask the wrapped Executor to execute N number of tasks
 * at any given time.
 *
 * <p>
 * The intention is to use this with {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} with {@link SynchronousQueue}
 * with unbounded max capacity (so that for up to N tasks we keep creating more threads for work,
 * but beyond that we start to push the tasks into the queue of an infinite capacity.)
 * 
 * <p>
 * This is necessary because {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} tries to push work into the queue
 * first and only create more threads once the queue is full, so for a queue with infinite
 * capacity it'll never create threads beyond the core pool size.
 * See http://www.kimchy.org/juc-executorservice-gotcha/ for more discussion of this.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Because there's no call back to tell us when the wrapped {@link ExecutorService} has
 * finished executing something, this class needs to hand out the next task slightly
 * before the wrapped {@link ExecutorService} is done with the previous task. The net result
 * is that the wrapped {@link ExecutorService} will end up running N+1 threads (of which
 * 1 is almost always idle.) I'm not sure how to fix this.
