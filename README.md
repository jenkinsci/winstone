# What is Winstone?
Winstone is a command line interface around Jetty 12.0.x, which implements
Servlet 4.0 (JakartaEE 8/`javax.servlet.*`), WebSocket/JSR-356, and HTTP/2 support. It is used as the default
embedded servlet container in Jenkins (via the `executable` package in the `war` module)
and can be used by any other web applications that wants to be self-contained.

## History

Winstone was [originally a from-scratch servlet container by Rick Knowles](http://winstone.sourceforge.net/)
with a good command line interface. Over time, the upstream development
has halted, and it became impractical to maintain a from-scratch servlet
implementation on our own. To reduce this maintenance burden, the gut of
Winstone has been removed and delegated to Jetty, while CLI was preserved, and
we called it Winstone 2.0.

## License
The license of Winstone inherits its original license by Rick.

The Web-App DTD files (everything in the `src/javax/servlet/resources` and
`src/javax/servlet/jsp/resources` folders) are covered by the licenses
described at the top of each file (usually as licensed by Sun Microsystems).

As of v0.8.1, all other files are dual-licensed, under either
the Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL) as described in LICENSE-LGPL.txt,
or the Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL) as described in
LICENSE-CDDL.txt.

The goal of dual-licensing is to make Winstone as attractive as possible to
distributors of commercial webapps, while ensuring everyone benefits from
any improvements. The CDDL allows free distribution with any commercial
applications, while distribution with a GPL licensed webapp is also possible
under the LGPL. If you are unclear about which license applies to an
application you wish to distribute or sell, please contact me.

## Configuration file
You don't really need a config file, but sometimes it's handy to
be able to use the same settings each time without running through
the command history.

Winstone looks for a config file `winstone.properties` in the current directory
(or in the location specified with `--config`) at startup. It loads
the properties in this file, overrides them with any supplied command
line properties, and then starts itself.

This is just intended as a handy feature for people who want to cache
regular startup options, rather than using batch files.

## Deployment choices
The *simplest way* to use winstone is with a single webapp. To do this,
just supply the warfile or webroot directory as an argument:

* `java -jar winstone.jar <webroot or warfile>`, (this method auto-detects the type) or
* `java -jar winstone.jar --webroot=<webroot>`, or
* `java -jar winstone.jar --warfile=<warfile>`

## Development
If you have some unit test failures you may add an interface/ip alias such

``` sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.0.2 ```
